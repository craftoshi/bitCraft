  Bitcraft is a metaprotocol built on top of the bitmap standard. Its purpose is
  to enhance the protocol to allow not just land ownership, but also the
  creation of materials and objects.

# ðŸ“– Introduction to bitcraft

This whitepaper aims to introduce the bitcraft theory ruleset, with the intention of incentivizing discussion and eventually implement an Ordinals-based protocol or implementation to let all bitmap citizens to access it.&#x20;

This theory is to be seen as an extension of bitmap theory and recognizes the ownership of districts and parcels as described and implemented by the bitmap documentation.\

It also applies concepts of Digital Matter Theory as outlined in the related documentation and proposes a different framework for its implementation in the context of the bitmap metaverse. For coherence with the bitmap ecosystem, the Atlas created by Bitoshi Blockamoto and the bitmap developers will be used as a reference for block data.\

&#x20;\
Bitcraft creates an economy based on Digital Matter Theory (DMT) concepts, using bitmap as the base layer on which to build this economy on. Inside the bitcraft protocol, bitmap districts owners can harvest resources from their bitmaps and create assets out of it. By using DMT concepts, a series of constraints present themselves when building inside bitcraft, allowing for Digital Material Science and Material Engineering to take place. \
\
The bitcraft protocol tries to replicate real-world like conditions for the metaverse development. In the real world natural resources and Materials are non-arbitrary, but artificial objects, Artifacts, should be arbitrary in the way they are made, and costrained by the availability of non-arbitrary resources and space.
