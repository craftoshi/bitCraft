# ðŸ’¬ Craftoshi's thoughts

I developed this theory and framework because I believe the bitmap ecosystem and community should be independent of the protocol wars and centralized developments that have been happening in the last year. \
\
Bitcraft is an approach to democratize the metaverse so that anybody can create how they see fit. Some could say I made the rules but if you read carefully you will notice I don't have any direct incentive in this working out. Yes, I could sell some Artifacts with the provenance of having created bitcraft, I could make an interface to monetize on people using the protocol, but I have no control on what anybody builds with this, and if you don't like it, you can always fork it! If your ego is not hurt by not being in full control of the metaverse though, you are welcome to contribute to the development of bitcraft, ideally the citizens of bitmap will take in their hands the maintenance of the metaverse under this framework, but for now I will try to listen to the community and implement what it wants.\
\
I believe this is the direction the bitmap metaverse should take, as it allows everybody to really work together to a common goal. \
Within this framework, creators can be compensated for their work by selling Artifacts with their artistic provenance. Open builders can make Specs available for everybody to own assets without even inscribing a single model and creae their own spaces. \
The builders which are currently building different 3D implementations can use the bitcraft layout to determine how the space should be visualized but they have the possibility to add their touch and functionality to it. Imagine jumping from the IMSO metaverse to an inscribed.space one and finding your house always in the same place, maybe with different graphics or different experiences available in that specific space. They could even collaborate and create a Spec that gives functionality in both metaverses, instead of having specific assets that are not compatible in other "parallel" metaverses.\
And the bitmap citizens? Well, they would be.. free.\
\
This is Craftoshi's vision.\
