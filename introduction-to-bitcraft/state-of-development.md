description: Can we use bitcraft right now?

# ⚠️ State of development

While this paper aims at explaining the theory behind bitcraft and the way it could be implemented on chain, it SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AS AN OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION OR SPECIFICATION DOCUMENT. There is no indexing currently active for the bitcraft protocol and it will be clearly communicated when the protocol will be considered officially running. Do not inscribe anything expecting to have those assets recognized by the bitcraft indexers.\
\
This is to allow an open discussion to take place in order to refine the technical implementation of the protocol and make sure it's robust before having it live.&#x20;

For the final implementation, it would be ideal to use Atlas as a reference for data points.
