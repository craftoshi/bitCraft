# ðŸ’¸ Artifacts 101

Materials can be combined to create Artifacts. A Spec needs to be created that specifies the necessary materials and/or other Artifacts needed to create a new Artifact.&#x20;

\
An existing inscription needs to be used as a reference to what the Artifact will look like. An Artifact can be anything an inscription is allowed to be. This means that even though the most obvious application for Artifacts in the context of bitcraft and bitmap is 3D objects, any type of file can be crafted as an Artifact and then can be combined with other Artifacts to achieve functionality, this can include images, audio, text or even scripts!

\
For example, we could craft a 3D model of a stereo speaker, some MP3 files containing songs, and then craft them together.&#x20;

\
This also allows developers who wish to create a 3D implementation of bitcraft (metaverse, game engine, etc) to craft different functionalities as Artifacts that the users can combine with their existing objects to achieve functionality in that specific implementation. For example, if you have a 3D model of a car you might need to acquire a "Driving License Spec" and craft it with your car to be able to use it in a specific implementation of bitcraft. If an Artifact becomes popular other developers can decide to recognize that functionality or implement automatic functionality for it in their implementation of bitcraft and so on. &#x20;
